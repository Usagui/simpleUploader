- 3 files only (no framework)
- this is a very simple php class to upload files
- code is very short
- if file is a zip it is automatically extracted but not recursively
- can add multiple input file
- upload is thru ajax

@todo:

one could use if < php 5.4 the APC extension to create progress bar or with session.upload var if >= php 5.4
